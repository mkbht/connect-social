throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ?
cattaneo reworks the formula that made the full monty a smashing success . . . but neglects to add the magic that made it all work .
routine and rather silly .
a rip-off twice removed , modeled after [seagal's] earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat .
totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time .
you can practically hear george orwell turning over .
behan's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance .

lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling .

lyne's latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded .
it sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that's more or less how it plays out .
rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic .
report card : doesn't live up to the exalted tagline - there's definite room for improvement . doesn't deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) .
the pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated .
as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you , this is f * * * ed' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience .
 . . . if it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious-- at ninety minutes , it drags .
bean drops the ball too many times . . . hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .
a well-acted , but one-note film .
blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period .
the movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .
[lee] treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects . and lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .

whether it's the worst movie of 2002 , i can't say for sure : memories of rollerball have faded , and i skipped country bears . but this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .
[a] boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain .
not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of 'eh . '
rollerball is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .

a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr . chicken .
a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis .
where the film falters is in its tone .
the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .

while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .
it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .
a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance .
a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .

this thing is virtually unwatchable .
those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time . feel free to go get popcorn whenever he's not onscreen .

aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me .
a preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in brooklyn circa 1958 .
has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9 � weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " .
everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line .
